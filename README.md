## Objectives
In this course, you will cover the representation, utilisation, and acquisition of knowledge. These are the cornerstones of AI. You will investigate how to take a real world problem and represent it in a computer, so that the computer can solve that problem. Utilising this knowledge, or acquiring new knowledge, is done by search. The basics of search and its use in planning will be covered. Machine learning will be covered, including the diï¬€erence between induction and deduction and the similarities between machine learning and optimisation.
